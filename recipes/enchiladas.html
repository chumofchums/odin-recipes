    <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil (or olive oil)</li>
    <li>1 small white onion, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced</li>
    <li>4 oz can diced green chiles</li>
    <li>15 oz can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol style="line-height: 120%;">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 3
      minutes, stirring occasionally. Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and
      pepper. Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through. Add in
      the beans and stir until evenly combined. Remove pan from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada
      sauce, chicken mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of
      the tortilla. Add a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla, then
      sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla and place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Assemble the
      remaining enchiladas. Then spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra
      cheese.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are cooked through and the
      tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside. Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Serve the enchiladas immediately while they’re nice and hot and melty, garnished
      with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy!</li>
