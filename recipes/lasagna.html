  <h3>This Lasagna is what I serve to my family and friends when I want them to overeat and yell over one another
  </h3>
  <p>Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a "tough room" when it comes to Italian
    recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in
    approval!</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
    <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>12 oz tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp basil</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tbs fresh parsley</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol style="line-height: 120%;">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat
      until
      well browned. Stir in
      crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
      seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
      occasionally.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
      boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
      Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley,
      and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
      dish. Arrange 6 noodles
      lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
      cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat
      layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray
      foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25
      minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
      before serving.</li>
  </ol>
