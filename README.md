First Odin project: Recipes

This HTML Project is the first TOP project in which a Homepage is created with links to three different recipes. The recipe pages contain a corresponding image, ingredients lists, and instructions for each dish. There are links at the bottom of the page that link back to the homepage.

CSS style was later added to the Homepage and the three recipe pages
